                   draft-barnes-mls-addl-creds-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines two new kinds of credentials for use
   within the Message Layer Security (MLS) credential framework:
   UserInfo Verifiable Credentials and multi-credentials.  UserInfo
   Verifiable Credentials allow clients to present credentials that
   associate OpenID Connect attributes to a signature key pair held by
   the client.  Multi-credentials allow clients to present authenticated
   attributes from multiple sources, or to present credentials in
   different formats to support groups with heterogeneous credential
   support.

1.  Introduction

   MLS provides end-to-end authenticated key exchange
   [I-D.ietf-mls-protocol].  Each client participating in an MLS group
   is authenticated with a credential.  The MLS credential structure is
   extensible: New MLS credential formats can be defined which support
   new mechanisms for authenticating clients.

   In this document, we define two new types of credential:

   *  Credentials based on OpenID Connect UserInfo Verifiable
      Credentials

   *  Multi-credentials that present several credentials at once

   UserInfo Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are a mechanism by which an
   OpenID Provider can bind user attributes to a signature key pair.
   OpenID Connect is already widely deployed as a mechanism for
   connecting authentication services to applications, and the OpenID
   Foundation is in the process of standardizing the extensions required
   for OpenID Providers to issue UserInfo VCs.

   Multi-credentials address use cases where there might not be a single
   credential that captures all of a client's authenticated attributes.
   For example, an enterprise messaging client may wish to provide
   attributes both from its messaging service, to prove that its user
   has a given handle in that service, and from its corporate owner, to
   prove that its user is an employee of the corporation.  Multi-
   credentials can also be used in migration scenarios, where some
   clients in a group might wish to rely on a newer type of credential,
   but other clients haven't yet been upgraded.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   This specification uses terms from the MLS Protocol specification.
   In particular, we refer to the MLS Credential object, which
   represents an association between a client's identity and the
   signature key pair that the client will use to sign messages in the
   MLS key exchange protocol.

3.  UserInfo Verifiable Credentials

   As described in the MLS architecture, MLS requires an Authentication
   Service (AS) as well as a Delivery Service (DS)
   [I-D.ietf-mls-architecture].  The full security goals of MLS are only
   realized if the AS and DS are non-colluding.  In other words,
   applications can deploy MLS to get end-to-end encryption (acting as
   MLS Delivery Service), but they need to partner with a non-colluding
   Authentication Service in order to achieve full end-to-end security.

   OpenID Connect is widely used to integrate identity providers with
   applications, but its current core protocol doesn't provide the
   binding to cryptographic keys required for use in MLS.  When OpenID
   Connect is coupled with the "Verifiable Credentials" framework,
   however, it can be used to provision clients with signed "UserInfo
   VC" objects that contain the critical elements of a credential to be
   used in MLS:

   *  Identity attributes for the user of a client

   *  A public key whose private key is held by a client

   *  A signature over the above by a trusted identity provider

   The required updates to OpenID Connect are specfied in
   [OpenIDUserInfoVC].  That document defines a profile of the OpenID
   for Verifiable Credential Issuance protocol for issuing "UserInfo
   Verifiable Credentials".  These credentials bind a signature key pair
   to the user attributes typically exposed through the OpenID Connect
   UserInfo endpoint.

   A "UserInfoVC" credential encapsulates a UserInfo Verifiable
   Credential object, so that it can be used for authenticating an MLS
   client.  We also describe the validation process that MLS clients use
   to verify UserInfoVC objects that they receive via MLS.

               OpenID Connect UserInfo VC MLS Credential Flow

   Figure 1: The protocol interactions to issue and verify a UserInfo VC

   The basic steps showing OIDC Verifiable Credential based MLS
   credential flow are shown in Figure 1.

   Client 1 is an MLS client that acts as a Holder in the VC model.
   Client 2 is also an MLS client, but acts in the Verifier role in the
   VC model.  Both clients implement certain OpenID Connect operations
   to obtain and verify UserInfo VC objects.

   1.  Client 1 generates a signature key pair using an algorithm that
       is supported by both MLS and UserInfo VC.

   2.  Client 1 performs an OpenID Connect login interaction with the
       scope "userinfo_credential" to obtain UserInfo VCs.

   3.  Client 1 sends a Credential Request specifying that it desires a
       UserInfo VC, together with a proof that it controls the private
       key of a signature key pair and the access token.

   4.  The OpenID Provider verifies the proof and create a Credential
       Response containing the UserInfo VC attesting the claims that
       would have been provided by the UserInfo endpoint and public key
       corresponding to the private key used to compute the proof in the
       Credential Request.

   5.  Client 1 generates a UserInfoVC MLS Credential object with the
       signed UserInfo VC JWT.  Client 1 embeds the UserInfoVC in an MLS
       KeyPackage object and signs the KeyPackage object with the
       corresponding private key.

   6.  Client 1 sends the KeyPackage to Client 2, e.g., by posting it to
       a directory from which Client 2 fetches it when it wants to add
       Client 1 to a group.

   7.  Client 2 verifies the signature on the KeyPackage and extracts
       the UserInfoVC credential.  Client 2 uses OpenID Connect
       Discovery to fetch the OpenID Provider's JWK set.

   8.  Client 2 verifies the signed UserInfo VC using the the
       appropriate key from the OpenID Provider's JWK set.

   If all checks pass, Client 2 has a high degree of assurance of the
   identity of Client 1.  At this point Client 1's KeyPackage (including
   the VerifiableCredential) will be included in the MLS group's ratchet
   tree and distributed to the other members of the group.  The other
   members of the group can verify the VerifiableCredential in the same
   way as Client 2.

3.2.  UserInfoVC

   A new credential type UserInfoVC is defined as shown below.  This
   credential type is indicated with the CredentialType value
   userinfo_vc (see Section 7).

   struct {
       opaque jwt<0..2^32-1>;
   } UserInfoVC;

   The jwt field contains the signed JWT-formatted UserInfo VC object
   (as defined in [OpenIDUserInfoVC]), encoded using UTF-8.  The payload
   of object MUST provide iss and vc claims.  The iss claim is used to
   look up the OpenID Provider's metadata.  The vc claim contains
   authenticated user attributes and a public key binding.
   Specifically, the field vc.credentialSubject.id contains a did:jwk
   URI describing the subject's public key as a JWK.

3.3.  Credential Validation

   An MLS client validates a UserInfoVC credential in the context of an
   MLS LeafNode with the following steps:

   *  Verify that the jwt field parses successfully into a JWT
      [!@RFC7519], whose payload parses into UserInfo object as defined
      in Section 5.3.2 of [!@OpenID].

   *  Verify that an iss claim is present in the UserInfo VC payload and
      that "iss" value represents and issuer that is trusted according
      to the client's local policy.

   *  Verify the JWT signature:

      -  Fetch the issuer metadata using OIDC Discovery
         [@!OpenID.Discovery].

      -  Use the jwks_uri field in the metadata to fetch the JWK set.

      -  Verify that the JWT signature verifies under one of the keys in
         the JWK set.

   *  Verify the key binding:

      -  Verify that a vc claim is present in the UserInfo VC payload.

      -  Verify that the value of the claim is a JSON object that
         contains a credentialSubject field, as defined in Section 4 of
         openid-userinfo-vc.

      -  Verify id field exists and it MUST be a a Decentralized
         Identifier with DID method jwk (W3c.did-core).

      -  Verify that the jwk field parses as a JWK.

      -  Verify that the signature_key in the LeafNode matches the key
         in the id field.

   If all of the above checks pass, the client can use the signature key
   in the JWK for verifying MLS signatures using the signature scheme
   corresponding to the kty and crv parameters in the JWK.  The identity
   attributes in the JWT should be associated with the MLS client that
   presented the credential.

3.4.  Mapping between JWK Key Types and MLS Ciphersuites

   Below table maps JWK key types (kty) and elliptic curves (crv) to the
   equivalent MLS signature scheme.

             +=====+=========+==============================+
             | kty |   crv   | TLS/MLS signature scheme     |
             +=====+=========+==============================+
             |  EC |  P-256  | ECDSA with P-256 and SHA-256 |
             +-----+---------+------------------------------+
             |  EC |  P-384  | ECDSA with P-384 and SHA-384 |
             +-----+---------+------------------------------+
             |  EC |  P-521  | ECDSA with P-521 and SHA-512 |
             +-----+---------+------------------------------+
             |  EC | Ed25519 | Ed25519                      |
             +-----+---------+------------------------------+
             |  EC |  Ed448  | Ed448                        |
             +-----+---------+------------------------------+

                                 Table 1

4.  Multi-Credentials

   New credential types MultiCredential and WeakMultiCredential are
   defined as shown below.  These credential types are indicated with
   CredentialType values multi and weak-multi (see Section 7).

   struct {
     CipherSuite cipher_suite;
     Credential credential;
     SignaturePublicKey credential_key;

     /* SignWithLabel(., "CredentialBindingTBS", CredentialBindingTBS) */
     opaque signature<V>;
   } CredentialBinding

   struct {
     CredentialBinding bindings<V>;
   } MultiCredential;

   struct {
     CredentialBinding bindings<V>;
   } WeakMultiCredential;

   The two types of credentials are processed in exactly the same way.
   The only difference is in how they are treated when evaluating
   support by other clients, as discussed below.

4.1.  Credential Bindings

   A multi-credential consists of a collection of "credential bindings".
   Each credential binding is a signed statement by the holder of the
   credential that the signature key in the LeafNode belongs to the
   holder of that credential.  Specifically, the signature is computed
   using the MLS SignWithLabel function, with label
   "CredentialBindingTBS" and with a content that covers the contents of
   the CredentialBinding, plus the signature_key field from the LeafNode
   in which this credential will be embedded.

   struct {
     CipherSuite cipher_suite;
     Credential credential;
     SignaturePublicKey credential_key;
     SignaturePublicKey signature_key;
   } CredentialBindingTBS;

   The cipher_suite for a credential is NOT REQUIRED to match the cipher
   suite for the MLS group in which it is used, but MUST meet the
   support requirements with regard to support by group members
   discussed below.

4.2.  Verifying a Multi-Credential

   A credential binding is supported by a client if the client supports
   the credential type and cipher suite of the binding.  A credential
   binding is valid in the context of a given LeafNode if both of the
   following are true:

   *  The credential is valid according to the MLS Authentication
      Service.

   *  The credential_key corresponds to the specified credential, in the
      same way that the signature_key would have to correspond to the
      credential if the credential were presented in a LeafNode.

   *  The signature field is valid with respect to the signature_key
      value in the leaf node.

   A client that receives a credential of type multi in a LeafNode MUST
   verify that all of the following are true:

   *  All members of the group support credential type multi.

   *  For each credential binding in the multi-credential:

      -  Every member of the group supports the cipher suite and
         credential type values for the binding.

      -  The binding is valid in the context of the LeafNode.

   A client that receives a credential of type weak-multi in a LeafNode
   MUST verify that all of the following are true:

   *  All members of the group support credential type multi.

   *  Each member of the group supports at least one binding in the
      multi-credential.  (Different members may support different
      subsets.)

   *  Every binding that this client supports is valid in the context of
      the LeafNode.

5.  Security Considerations

   The validation procedures for UserInfoVC credentials verify that a
   JWT came from a given issuer.  It doesn't verify that the issuer is
   authorative for the claimed attributes.  The client needs to verify
   that the issuer is trusted to assert the claimed attributes.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   UserInfo can contain sensitive info such as human names, phone
   numbers, and using these credentials in MLS will expose this
   information to other group members, and potentially others if used in
   a prepublished KeyPackage.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  MLS Credential Types

   IANA is requested to register add the following new entries to the
   MLS Credential Type registry.
